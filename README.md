# Task-Board-Mng

## Description

This was meant to be a way to get used to jQuery, dayjs, and bootstrap components. Most of the work was done in script.js, to which I mostly stumbled. I got nothing working, but I will get help later.

## Installation

## Usage

The site is blank at first, and pressing the 'Add Task' button takes you to a modal.

The 'due date' field has a datepicker attached.

There would be more if it worked, but currently the JavaScript is at a stalemate with itself. Apologies.

## Credits

Helped figure out what I could use to generate an id:

Most code used was from the mini project from Third-Party-APIs.
