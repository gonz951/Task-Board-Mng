# Task-Board-Mng

## Description

This was meant to be a way to get used to jQuery, dayjs, and bootstrap components. Most of the work was done in script.js, to which I mostly stumbled. I got nothing working, but I will get help later.

## Table of Contents

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

It's a webpage; Nothing more than this: 

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

Helped figure out what I could use to generate an id:

Most code used was from the mini project from Third-Party-APIs.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
